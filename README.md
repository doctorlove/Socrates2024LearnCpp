# Socrates2024LearnCpp
Learn C++ workshop

This is the repo for my [SoCraTesUK](https://scrts.de/socratesuk2024/) workshop, "Learn C++ by Example".

We created a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. You need a C++ tool, or can try on [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/qanE4doMo).

You need to write some output, figure out how to get input and make your computer randomly pick a turn. Bonus points for deciding who won.


The slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jjln1Qs1xmrB_ko2itmKW9_0rXGreHkRpXwo1IPML48/edit?usp=sharing)
